Hello there!

Thank you for wanting to add more awesome speakers here!

Our suggestions for adding new speakers:

* Add people that you believe hold awesome talks
* For privacy reasons, let people know you are adding them here ([example tweet](https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/927550556570357760))

Format ([example pull request](https://github.com/karlhorky/awesome-speakers/pull/35/files)):

* An image (Twitter profile picture is best) - remember to add the alt tag!
* Line 1: Name of the speaker
* Line 2: Topics they talk about, capitalized (future topics in parentheses)
* Line 3: Contact link (Twitter preferred)
* Line 3: If relevant, further links such as slides, separated by bullets ([example pull request](https://github.com/karlhorky/awesome-speakers/pull/49))

Also please always leave two spaces after Line 1 and 2 for formatting reasons.

Thank you for reading!
